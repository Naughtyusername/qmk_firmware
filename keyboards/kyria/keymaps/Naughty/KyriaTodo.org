*todo for kyria


* Todo
 *Consider changing the MT windows key to G and H or something else. its useful, i need it
 but its not so important that it needs to be right on homerow, i think. worth trying another spot
 Change the symbols layer again, not super happy with it. utalize thumb cluster more.

 *use tap dance or leader to allow us to toggle into vi mode and out of vi mode
 * Leader key layer swapping?

 *
probably set debounce (i use 5 on my planck)
