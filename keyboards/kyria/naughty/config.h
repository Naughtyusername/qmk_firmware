// Allows sending more than one key per scan. By default, only one key event gets sent via process_record() per scan. This has little impact on most typing, but if you're doing a lot of chords, or your scan rate is slow to begin with, you can have some delay in processing key events. Each press and release is a separate event. For a keyboard with 1ms or so scan times, even a very fast typist isn't going to produce the 500 keystrokes a second needed to actually get more than a few ms of delay from this. But if you're doing chording on something with 3-4ms scan times? You probably want this.
